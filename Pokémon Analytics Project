--In this project, I am querying Pokemon data to quantify statistics.

--I determined which Pokemon has the most and least health points.
SELECT name
,MAX(HP) AS max_hp 
FROM pokemon
;
SELECT name
,MIN(HP) AS min_hp 
FROM pokemon
;

--Next, I specified the average speed of all the Pokemon.
SELECT AVG(Speed) AS avg_spd 
FROM pokemon
;

--Then I selected the Pokemon types with an average attack value greater than 95.
SELECT Type_1
,AVG(Attack) AS avg_atk 
FROM pokemon 
GROUP BY Type_1 
HAVING avg_atk > 95
;

--Next, I defined the Pokemon considered fast, average, or slow.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total
,CASE
WHEN Speed > 90 THEN "Fast"
WHEN Speed > 68 THEN "Average"
ELSE "Slow"
END AS "speed_cat"
FROM pokemon 
GROUP BY speed_cat
;

--Finally, I determined how many Pokemon are both ghost and grass types.
SELECT COUNT(*) AS Total
FROM pokemon 
WHERE Type_1 = "Grass" 
AND Type_2 = "Ghost" 
OR Type_1 = "Ghost" 
AND Type_2 = "Grass"
;
