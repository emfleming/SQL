--This project involved querying multiple tables in a database to provide insights into customer data for a digital media store.

--First, I searched which customers were outside the USA.
SELECT FirstName
,LastName
,CustomerID
,Country 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country != 'USA'
;
--Next, I found the invoices of customers from France.
SELECT cust.FirstName
,cust.LastName
,inv.InvoiceID
,inv.InvoiceDate
,inv.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust
ON inv.CustomerID=cust.CustomerID
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = 'France'
;
--Then I calculated the invoice total of each customer, their country and the sales agent that helped them.
SELECT emp.FirstName AS Employee_First
,emp.LastName AS Employee_Last
,cust.FirstName AS Customer_First
,cust.LastName AS Customer_Last
,cust.Country
,inv.Total
FROM chinook.invoices inv
JOIN chinook.customers cust ON cust.CustomerID=inv.CustomerID
JOIN chinook.employees emp ON emp.EmployeeID=cust.SupportRepID
;
--Finally, I analyzed the total cost each customer spent for their invoices and displayed each customer's purchased tracks, albums, media type, and genre.
SELECT cust.FirstName AS Customer_First
,cust.LastName AS Customer_Last
,SUM(inv.Total) OVER(PARTITION BY inv.InvoiceId) AS Invoice_Total
,trk.Name AS Track_Name
,alb.Title AS Album_Title
,mt.Name AS Media_Type
,gn.Name AS Genre_Name
FROM chinook.customers cust
JOIN chinook.invoices inv ON inv.CustomerId=cust.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.invoice_items init ON init.InvoiceId=inv.InvoiceId
JOIN chinook.tracks trk ON trk.TrackId=init.TrackId
JOIN chinook.albums alb ON alb.AlbumId=trk.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.media_types mt ON mt.MediaTypeId=trk.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres gn ON gn.GenreId=trk.GenreId
ORDER BY cust.FirstName
